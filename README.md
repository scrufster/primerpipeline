# primerpipeline
A user-friendly Windows based program enveloping an automated pipeline for microsatellite mining and primer design for de novo low coverage genomes.

With the decreasing price and widening availability of Next Generation Sequencing it is now incredibly quick and simple to produce a library of sequences for species requiring microsatellite primers. However, taking this data to fruition: primers ready to test and optimise, can be difficult for those unfamiliar with bioinformatics. Most of the pipelines on offer are in the form of a Linux based command line, for ecologists not familiar with bioinformatics, scripts or the Linux language, this can be time consuming and potentially lead to mistakes. Here we introduce PrimerPipeline, an open source, user-friendly Windows based (GUI) program that does not require any bioinformatics knowledge and allows you to find microsatellites and design primers using the best, most established methods (MISA and Primer3) but develop, display and check the results in a novel, clear and simple way.

PrimerPipeline is written in C# using WPF.
